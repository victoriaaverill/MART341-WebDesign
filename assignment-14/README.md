My user testing sessions went very well. I found them to be incredibly beneficial and the simple changes made were very helpful. I used my sister and my dad because the variation of age I thought would be a good way to help me make my page more user-friendly with a variation in age. I was especially worried about my logo being the home page link. I was not sure if anyone would think to click on it. So I asked both my dad and sister where how they would get back to the home page and they seemed confused. This made me decide to add home page buttons on the bottom of each of my pages to keep things easy to navigate.
My sister also mentioned my use of color was distracting because the color palette seemed very different from one page to the next. I decided to stick with the dark blue and use white to make the text pop more. Both seemed to like those changes and agreed that the site was very easy to navigate and very legible.

This week I faced the challenge of reading through my code from the previous assignments and changing things to make my website more fluid. I wanted to make it more appealing to look at and there was a lot to be done. I see why organization is so important in web design. If you don't organize your code, it can be tough to back track! And making comments is extremely useful. I do feel more confident in being able to read and understand the relation between my CSS and HTML pages which makes me very happy.
