HTML has been very interesting. I really like it because to me it is like one big puzzle. You have to play around with it to make all the pieces fall into place. It is very challenging at times and there is a lot to keep track of. I took Creative Coding 1 and so it is not ENTIRELY new. Some of it rings a bell but for the most part is it all new to me.

I am anxious about CSS because I have learned that coding takes a lot of patience. Based on the styling I have done so far, the opportunities seem endless and I think that could be challenging to decide on what elements I would like to stick with in my projects. I am excited though!
