    Bio
  </h3>
  <p> Hi! My name is Victoria and I live in a small town in Montana. Ever since I sparked an interest for photography in high school, I have been
    eager to make something out of it. I bought my first camera my sophomore year of college and although there was a slight learning curve, I did my best to hit the
      ground running. I practice any chance I get and have done everything from weddings to senior portraits to website photos for business. I love making things
      people look at or walk past every day look like gold. I have started using that to help small businesses develop quality photos that make people stop and
      become interested in what they see. I am working on a degree in Media Arts and plan to then venture into marketing. I am always looking for experience and hope
      to make Victo Media into something bigger than just me.
